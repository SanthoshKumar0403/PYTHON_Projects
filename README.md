## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools

This project followed a standard Data Science workflow, demonstrating proficiency in Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

* **Tools:** **Python** (Jupyter Notebook), **Pandas** (Data Cleaning and Manipulation), **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization).
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values (`NaN`), dropped irrelevant columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`), and corrected data types for key financial and order columns.
* **Feature Engineering:** Consolidated categorical variables (e.g., `Age Group`, `Occupation`) to ensure correct grouping for analysis.
* **Key Metrics Analyzed:** Sales (`Amount`), Orders (`Orders`), Customer Demographics (`Gender`, `Age Group`, `Marital Status`, `State`).

## 📈 Key Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

The analysis focused on identifying the highest-value customer segments by analyzing spend and order volume across various demographic factors.

### 1. Sales by Gender & Marital Status

The data clearly indicates that **Female customers** drive significantly higher sales and order volume compared to male customers. Furthermore, **Married women** are the dominant spending group. This highlights the importance of targeting products and advertising toward married female consumers.



### 2. Top Performing Geographies

The analysis of sales by state revealed strong regional preferences, which is critical for logistics and state-specific marketing campaigns.

* **Top 3 States by Sales:** **Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra, and Karnataka** account for the majority of the total sales amount.
* **Recommendation:** Marketing resources and inventory stock should be heavily concentrated in these three high-value states.



### 3. High-Value Product Categories

Understanding which product categories drive revenue helps in inventory management and seasonal stocking decisions.

* **Top 3 Product Categories by Orders:** **Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics**.
* These categories represent the highest frequency of purchases during the Diwali season, confirming their status as essential festive items.
